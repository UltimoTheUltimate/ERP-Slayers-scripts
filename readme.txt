This is a Java program for ERP slayers developed by Ultimo_The_Ultimate. Source files can be found in the src file.

SETTING UP:

The user needs to ensure that there are 4 CSV files in the root of the JAR file labeled username.csv, description.csv, avatar.csv and miscellaneous.csv.
These CSV files will contain your own report reasons which must follow the following format which applies in all CSV files:

        title,reason
e.g.    Nude Avatar,avatar is nude

It is recommended that there are no fullstops at the end and that the reasons start on a lowercase to make the sentence more seamless.
The resultant reason String will be as follows;

In username: reason1, reason2, ... . In avatar: reason 1, reason 2, ... . In Description: reason1, reason2, ... . miscellaneous reason1. miscellaneous reason2 ... .

Note: miscellaneous reasons are separated with fullstops since they are specific, and it makes more sense if configured properly.
